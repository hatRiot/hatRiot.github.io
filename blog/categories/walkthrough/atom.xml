    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>pwnOS is a vulnerable VM used in penetration testing and vulnerability assessment.  I thought this one was pretty fun, so I&rsquo;ve decided to do a little write up in the various ways it can be attacked.  The VM for it can be found on forums.hackingdojo.com; you need an account to access the forums, but it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>

<p>The VM comes packaged as a split vmdk, so just loading up the vmx sets everything up.  Booting it up and flipping over to BackTrack, a quick nmap scan gives us a few immediate vectors of attack:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012/scan.jpg" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>So there&rsquo;s a few notable things here; the OpenSSH version, specifically that Debian build, is known to generate weak, predictable SSH keys.  This vulnerability is due to a side-effect of removing a bit of code that effected the initial seeding for the PRNG; instead of seeding it with true, random data, it instead only used a process ID. There are a total of 32,768 process ID&rsquo;s available, meaning, only 32,768 potential seeds to the PRNG.  We can attack this by generating a 2048 bit key (that&rsquo;s the bit size of the RSA key, according to nmap) 32,768 times with the number as a seed.  We&rsquo;ll set this aside, for now, and come back to it.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an HTTP server up with some plaintext HTML on it, but nothing worthy of any web-side exploits.  That version of Apache has some DoS vulnerabilities, but that doesn&rsquo;t do much for us.</p>

<p>The next interesting port is actually on 10000; MiniServ is a fairly obscure, hyperminimal web server written in C.  It&rsquo;s barely supported and has a very low exposure level.  On the frontend runs WebMin, a PHP interface for HTTP servers.  As it happens to turn out, there&rsquo;s a vulnerability allowing an attacker to retrieve unauthorized remote files.  This will work harmoniously with our OpenSSH vulnerability above!  I pulled some perl code from <a href="http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/2017/">here</a> and dumped a few things:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012/webmin.jpg" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Oh boy users!  Lets back up for a minute and take a look at this exploit.  If we pop open the perl code, we see a little bit of this:</p>

<p>```
 $temp=&ldquo;/..%01&rdquo; x 40;</p>

<pre><code>    if ($tar == '0')
       { my $url= "http://". $target. ":" . $port ."/unauthenticated/".$temp . $filename;
        $content=get $url;

        print("\n FILE CONTENT STARTED");
        print("\n -----------------------------------\n");

        print("$content");
        print("\n -------------------------------------\n");
        }
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s about as easy as it gets when it comes to exploits; we&rsquo;re filling up the url with /..%01.  It does this 40 times until the buffer is full, then appends the filename onto the end.    I dug into the Webmin source code to see exactly what was going on; diffing 1.28 and 1.29, I found this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012/diff.jpg" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Essentially it was checking for a directory traversal in the path, but only checking &ldquo;..&rdquo;.  In our exploit, we&rsquo;re appending a %01, which is the ASCII Start of Header.  This final, encoded ASCII code can be any control code; that&rsquo;s %00 &ndash; %1F (<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp">codes</a>).  This works because these codes have no purpose in the URL and do not decode to anything useful; they merely throw off the $b eq &ldquo;..&rdquo; check by doing nothing.  The remainder of the code is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve got a few names, we can run through RSA keys and see if we get a match.  HD Moore of Metasploit has already generated and distributed the keys, and can be retrieved <a href="http://metasploit.com/users/hdm/tools/debian-openssl/">here</a>.  Got &lsquo;em?  Cool; now we can test keys against the usernames in the file.  I used <a href="http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/5632/">this</a> to iterate through them, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to code it up yourself.  Essentially we just want to connect to the server with one of the usernames with the generated keys; when we pop a shell, we know we&rsquo;re in:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012/brute.jpg" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>So now we&rsquo;ve got ourselves a private RSA key for account &lsquo;obama&rsquo;.  Testing it out, and&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012/ssh.jpg" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Success!  So now we&rsquo;ve got a valid account on the box.  We see it&rsquo;s an x86 Ubuntu machine on the 2.6.22 kernel.  What can we do?  Well, immediately I recognize a major vulnerability in the kernel version.  A bit of googling will turn up the vmsplice exploit.  The exploit itself is in fact a chaining of three separate, now patched, vulnerabilities in the fs/splice.c module.  I will let the fantastic article at <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/268783/">lwn</a> describe the vulnerability in more detail, and instead put it to some use here:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2012/vmsplice_root.jpg" title="&lsquo;image&rsquo; &lsquo;iamges&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>And just like that we&rsquo;ve got root on the box.</p>

<p>Other avenues of attack could be sticking Medusa/Hydra on the SSH port and letting it brute force the accounts, exploiting remote uploads to MiniServ, or the local ftruncate root exploit.  Though fairly easy and straightforward (I didn&rsquo;t have to write a line of code), this VM was fun to toy around with.</p>
