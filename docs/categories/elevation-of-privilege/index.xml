      <description>Back in March or April I began reversing a slew of Dell applications installed on a laptop I had. Many of them had privileged services or processes running and seemed to perform a lot of different complex actions. I previously disclosed a LPE in SupportAssist[0], and identified another in their Digital Delivery platform. This post will detail a Digital Delivery vulnerability and how it can be exploited. This was privately discovered and disclosed, and no known active exploits are in the wild.</description>
