      <description>Gitlist is a fantastic repository viewer for Git; it&amp;rsquo;s essentially your own private Github without all the social networking and glitzy features of it. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a private Gitlist that I run locally, as well as a professional instance for hosting internal projects. Last year I noticed a bug listed on their Github page that looked a lot like an exploitable hole:
Oops! sh: 1: Syntax error: EOF in backquote substitution I commented on its exploitability at the time, and though the hole appears to be closed, the issue still remains.</description>
