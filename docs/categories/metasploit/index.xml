      <description>One of my primary goals during development of clusterd was ensuring reliability and covertness during remote deploys. It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that antivirus routinely eats vanilla meterpreter shells. For this, the --gen-payload flag generates a war file with java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp tucked inside. This is used due to it being largely undetected by AV, and our environments are perfectly suited for it. However, Meterpreter is a fantastic piece of software, and it&amp;rsquo;d be nice to be able to elevate from this simple JSP shell into it.</description>
