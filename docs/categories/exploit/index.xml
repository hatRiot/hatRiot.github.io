      <description>Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve seen and exploited the occasional leaked handle bug. These can be particularly fun to toy with, as the handles aren&amp;rsquo;t always granted PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS or THREAD_ALL_ACCESS, requiring a bit more ingenuity. This post will address the various access rights assignable to handles and what we can do to exploit them to gain elevated code execution. I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to focus specifically on process and thread handles as this seems to be the most common, but surely other objects can be exploited in similar manner.</description>

      <title>ntpdc local buffer overflow</title>

      <description>Alejandro Hdez (@nitr0usmx) recently tweeted about a trivial buffer overflow in ntpdc, a deprecated NTP query tool still available and packaged with any NTP install. He posted a screenshot of the crash as the result of a large buffer passed into a vulnerable gets call. After digging into it a bit, I decided it&amp;rsquo;d be a fun exploit to write, and it was. There are a few quarks to it that make it of particular interest, of which I&amp;rsquo;ve detailed below.</description>
