      <description>It would appear that these vulnerabilities were disclosed a few years ago (CVE-2008-2002 and CVE-2006-5196), but my relatively new (1-2 years) Motorola Surfboard SB5101U (verified against both the 101 and 101U), loaded with SB5101NU-2.1.7.0-GA-00-388-NOSH, appears to be vulnerable to the same CSRF&amp;rsquo;s exposed prior. With no authentication system in place at all, it would appear that a local DoS is not much of a concern to them. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that, despite the sudden flood of discovered vulnerabilities in routers, nobody is really taking a look at the other piece of hardware between you and the ISP.</description>
