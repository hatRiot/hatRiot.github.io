      <description>OpenEMM is one of the most popular enterprise-grade email marketing software currently on the market; the best part of it, too, is that it&amp;rsquo;s free and open source. The entire stack is java, with some random shell/Python scripts for configuration. On inspection of the software, it appeared there were several SQL injection vulnerabilities due in part to a lack of input sanitation. This vulnerability was privately disclosed to the vendor, and a patch will be released shortly and backported to OpenEMM 2013 and 2011.</description>

      <title>PHD Help Desk 2.12 - SQLi/XSS</title>

      <description>PHD Help Desk is a help desk application used for managing help tickets in corporate/enterprise environments. The latest version (2.12) is vulnerable to, well, quite a few instances of SQLi and XSS. I&amp;rsquo;ll try and go through a couple, but there are so many it&amp;rsquo;s sort of embarrassing, and none of them are at all complex. The software is clocking ~200 downloads/week on Sourceforge, and no telling how many off their website, so it&amp;rsquo;s definitely still out there somewhere.</description>
