      <description>In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll examine the exploitability of CVE-2021-1648, a privilege escalation bug in splwow64. I actually started writing this post to organize my notes on the bug and subsystem, and was initially skeptical of its exploitability. I went back and forth on the notion, ultimately ditching the bug. Regardless, organizing notes and writing blogs can be a valuable exercise! The vector is useful, seems to have a lot of attack surface, and will likely crop up again unless Microsoft performs a serious exorcism on the entire spooler architecture.</description>

      <title>Dell SupportAssist Driver - Local Privilege Escalation</title>

      <description>This post details a local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerability I found in Dell&amp;rsquo;s SupportAssist[0] tool. The bug is in a kernel driver loaded by the tool, and is pretty similar to bugs found by ReWolf in ntiolib.sys/winio.sys[1], and those found by others in ASMMAP/ASMMAP64[2]. These bugs are pretty interesting because they can be used to bypass driver signature enforcement (DSE) ad infinitum, or at least until they&amp;rsquo;re no longer compatible with newer operating systems.</description>

      <description>This is just a placeholder post to link off to Stephen Breen and I&amp;rsquo;s paper on abusing token privileges. You can read the entire paper here[0]. I also recommend checking out the blogpost he posted on Foxglove here[1].
