      <description>OpenEMM is one of the most popular enterprise-grade email marketing software currently on the market; the best part of it, too, is that it&amp;rsquo;s free and open source. The entire stack is java, with some random shell/Python scripts for configuration. On inspection of the software, it appeared there were several SQL injection vulnerabilities due in part to a lack of input sanitation. This vulnerability was privately disclosed to the vendor, and a patch will be released shortly and backported to OpenEMM 2013 and 2011.</description>
