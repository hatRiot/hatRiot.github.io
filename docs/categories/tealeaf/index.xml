      <description>Tealeaf Technologies was purchased by IBM in May of 2012, and is a customer buying analytics application. Essentially, an administrator will configure a Tealeaf server that accepts analytic data from remote servers, which it then generates various models, graphs, reports, etc based on the aggregate of data. Their analytics status/server monitoring application is vulnerable to a fairly trivial OS command injection vulnerability, as well as local file inclusion. This vulnerability was discovered on a PCI engagement against a large retailer; the LFI was used to pull PHP files and hunt for RCE.</description>
