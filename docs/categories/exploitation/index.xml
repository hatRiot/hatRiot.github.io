      <description>In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll examine the exploitability of CVE-2021-1648, a privilege escalation bug in splwow64. I actually started writing this post to organize my notes on the bug and subsystem, and was initially skeptical of its exploitability. I went back and forth on the notion, ultimately ditching the bug. Regardless, organizing notes and writing blogs can be a valuable exercise! The vector is useful, seems to have a lot of attack surface, and will likely crop up again unless Microsoft performs a serious exorcism on the entire spooler architecture.</description>
