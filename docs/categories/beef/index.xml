      <description>Let me preface this post by saying that this vulnerability is already fixed, and was caught pretty early during the development process. The vulnerability was originally introduced during a merge for the new DNS extension, and was promptly patched by antisnatchor on 03022014. Although this vulnerability was caught fairly quickly, it still made it into the master branch. I post this only because I&amp;rsquo;ve seen too many penetration testers leaving their tools externally exposed, often with default credentials.</description>
